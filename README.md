Container to run [committed](https://github.com/akerl/committed), a Twilio endpoint for checking GitHub commit streak status

## Usage

```
docker pull dock0/committed
docker run -d -p 80:80 dock0/committed
```

If you want it to support registration (remembering which user texts from which phone number), set COMMITTED_DB to true and set REDIS_URL such that Redis is accessible:

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 -e COMMITTED_DB=true -e "REDIS_URL=redis://user:password@host:port/db" dock0/committed
```

I'd recommend using [dock0/redis](https://github.com/dock0/redis), but I'll admit to being a bit biased.
